### Javascript Object Set
Implement a set in javascript that can contain javascript objects. I.e., you should be able to insert, remove, and check for membership of arbitrary objects - each operation should take constant time.

Note: suppose we have objects A and B where A is not B, but A and B are equal. If we insert A into our set, we should still be able to tell that B is not in the set.
